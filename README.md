# 🤖 Quanta: Emergent Intelligence in Unknown Territories

*Scout Bot powered by Reinforcement Learning and Procedural Content Generation*

---

## 🌍 Project Overview

**Quanta** is a simulated autonomous robot deployed into unpredictable, procedurally generated environments. The goal of this project is to train Quanta — using reinforcement learning (Q-learning) — to navigate challenging terrains, avoid obstacles, and reach mission goals efficiently.

This project is part of a learning and development journey that explores the intersection of **game AI**, **procedural content generation (PCG)**, and **robotic behavior modeling** — all implemented from scratch using **Python** and **Pygame**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals (Phase 1)

- ✅ **Learn and build** a simulation from scratch using Pygame
- ✅ Implement a **grid-based world** where the robot (Quanta) can operate
- ✅ Create a **procedural map generator** to place obstacles and goals
- ✅ Design the robot movement logic and interaction with the environment
- 🚧 Lay the groundwork for **Q-learning-based agent behavior**
- 🧠 Begin **studying reinforcement learning and PCG techniques**

## 💡 Concept & Inspiration

In a futuristic world where environments are unstable and unsafe, **Quanta** is deployed as a scout robot to:
- Explore collapsed buildings
- Navigate alien terrains
- Avoid hazards like rubble and traps
- Locate safe zones or mission targets

The world is never the same twice — every map is **procedurally generated**, and Quanta must **learn from experience** to adapt and survive.

This project mirrors real-world challenges in:
- Search & rescue robotics
- Space exploration
- Intelligent agent design for games and simulations

## 📚 Learning Objectives

- Understand how procedural generation is used in games and robotics
- Implement Q-learning from scratch and apply it to a grid world
- Design and visualize agent behavior through training episodes
- Practice writing clean, modular Python code
- Learn how to combine simulation, AI, and storytelling in a game-like project

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- `Python 3.12.6`
- `Pygame` (2D simulation & visualization)
- `NumPy` (Q-table and math operations)
